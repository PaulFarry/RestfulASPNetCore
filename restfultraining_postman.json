May the Force be with you. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.\n\nI don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
